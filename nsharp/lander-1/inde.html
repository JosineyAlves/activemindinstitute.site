                <p>Hello, Health & Science viewers.<br>
                <p>Today, we’re joined by Dr. Nathan Caldwell, one of America’s most respected brain health researchers.</p>
                <p>After more than 20 years studying memory decline and cognitive performance, Dr. Caldwell and his team uncovered a hidden neurological factor quietly disrupting how the brain stores and retrieves information — something most experts completely overlooked.</p>
                <p>What they found challenges decades of conventional thinking about aging and memory loss — and offers a simple, natural way to help support sharper focus, mental clarity, and long-term brain strength.</p>
                <p>In this exclusive presentation, Dr. Caldwell breaks down the science behind this discovery and explains why major health corporations are not eager for it to reach the public.</p>
